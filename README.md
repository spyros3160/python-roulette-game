# FPGA Quadcopter

An FPGA-based quadcopter flight controller developed in VHDL using an Altera Cyclone IV FPGA.

This project aims to implement the core flight-control logic of a quadcopter directly in programmable hardware, without using a conventional microcontroller as the flight controller.

## Project Status

🚧 **In development**

The project currently starts with the implementation and verification of basic FPGA functionality.

The first hardware test uses the 50 MHz onboard clock of the DSD-i1 development board to drive an LED through a VHDL-based counter.

## Hardware

### Current Development Board

**DSD-i1 Digital System Design Development Board**

- FPGA: Altera Cyclone IV E EP4CE6E22C8
- FPGA resources: 6,272 Logic Elements
- Onboard clock: 50 MHz
- FPGA development tool: Quartus Prime 20.1 Lite
- HDL: VHDL

### Future Development Board

**Terasic DE10-Lite**

- FPGA: Intel MAX 10 10M50DAF484C7G
- Approximately 50,000 Logic Elements
- Onboard USB-Blaster
- 3.3 V GPIO
- FPGA development tool: Quartus Prime
- HDL: VHDL

The VHDL modules are being designed to remain portable between the DSD-i1 Cyclone IV FPGA and the future DE10-Lite MAX 10 FPGA.

Board-specific pin assignments and constraints will be kept separate from the reusable RTL design.

## Planned Architecture

The final flight controller is planned to contain the following hardware modules:

## Current FPGA Design

The current VHDL design implements a simple clock divider/counter.

The 50 MHz onboard clock is counted and the LED state is toggled every 25,000,000 clock cycles, producing a visible blinking signal.

This first design is used as a hardware verification step before implementing the more complex flight-controller modules.

## PWM Generator

The PWM generator is implemented as a reusable VHDL module.

The design uses a 50 MHz clock and generates a 50 Hz PWM signal with a 20 ms period.

The pulse width is configurable from 1000 μs to 2000 μs.

Typical values used during simulation:

- 1000 μs
- 1500 μs
- 2000 μs

The PWM module uses generic parameters for the clock frequency and PWM period, allowing the same RTL module to be reused with different FPGA clock frequencies.

## PWM Verification

The PWM generator was verified using ModelSim.

The simulation confirmed:

- 1000 μs pulse width
- 1500 μs pulse width
- 2000 μs pulse width
- 20 ms PWM period
- 50 Hz PWM frequency

The 1500 μs pulse width and 20 ms period were measured using ModelSim waveform cursors.

## FPGA Pin Assignments

The current hardware test uses the following DSD-i1 FPGA pins:

| Signal | FPGA Pin | Function |
|--------|----------|----------|
| `clk`  | `PIN_23` | 50 MHz onboard clock |
| `led`  | `PIN_110` | LED output |

I/O standard:

- 3.3-V LVCMOS

## Technologies

## Safety

Motor and ESC testing will initially be performed without propellers.

Flight-control development will be verified through simulation and controlled hardware testing before any flight testing.
